## 1.0 Introduction
### 1.1 Problem situation
The stakeholders are adults. The setting of the problem is theUnited States. The values are people’s health and well-being. The tensions are tasks, deadlines, and culture affecting how students are sleeping. There are no policies regarding sleep for adults. There are only policies for safe sleep regarding infants. The ethic elements that exist are that deadlines are usually set at reasonable times so adults are not forced to wake up or stay up at an unreasonable time.

### 1.2 What is the problem?
The main problem is adults not getting enough sleep every night, and it affects not only work performance but also both physical and mental health (Cunningham, 2019). The National Alliance on Mental Illness states that up to 44 percent of college students have reported themselves experiencing symptoms of depression, and 50 percent have suffered from anxiety, due to sleep deprivation caused by the overwhelming workload at college (“Mental Health Guide,” 2019).

### 1.3 What does it matter?
The problem of sleep deprivation matters because it influences physical and mental health, as well as their work and their relationships with others. Studies show that sleep deprivation in the long run impacts necessary skills that an adult needs to perform well such as memory recall or concentration, resulting in poor performance when working or doing assignments for school . Moreover, because of sleep deprivation’s impacts on their cognition, these students’ GPA do not correctly illustrate their understanding of the classes, making grading system less reliable to assess students’ understanding and knowledge-applying of the class. In addition, sleep deprivation can also contribute to mental disorders, such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety (Cunningham, 2019).
### 1.4 How it will be addressed?
Firstly, an ongoing trend of adults’ sleep deprivation will be dressed by using data in Sleep Deprivation. The proportion of samples among the population and the average hours of sleep should be calculated. Then by looking in a dataset about sleeping habits, we will figure out the reason why such pattern showed up and find out as many factors ranking from the most influential to the least. Since the real-world data is so complicated and the existence of feedback loops among factors is nothing to be sneezed at, more meta datasets are needed to address the correlation critically.


## 2.0 Research Questions
* How does sleep deprivation in the U.S affect adults' work performance?
* What is the trend of sleep deprivation in the U.S among adults? What are the effects?
* What are some major causes for sleep deprivation for adults in the U.S.?

## 3.0 Possible data sets

Name: Sleep Deprivation

Description: This dataset provides a wide variety of attributes for 90 participants. Some attributes include age group, BMI, education level, whether they have had depression, how long the participant’s sleep and types of sleep.

Number of Observations: 90

Number of Attributes: 100

Name: Sleep Study

Description: This dataset was collected from a survey-based study of US individuals’ sleeping habits. Phone use was one of the attributes to determine if phone use affects sleep. The survey also asked if the participants thought they got enough sleep.

## 4.0 Information Visualizations

**Sleepless Nights**

Figure 1: This data visualization is using color and shape to show how much sleep different age groups get. The main purpose for this data visualization is comparing and seeing who gets the most sleep and who gets the least sleep.

**The Facts on Sleeping Disorders**

Figure 2: There are multiple elements to this data visualization. The percentages on the right show what effects of sleep deprivation affect the population. The color blue is used to make the percentage stand out. The left side shows the scary effects of car crashes and accident deaths that sleep deprivation can create.


## 5.0 Team Coordination

Weekly time that everyone in the group can get together for at least two hours. Currently, will be Thursday 3:30 pm.

**Individual goals for the project and roles:**

**Vivian Law**

My individual goals for the project are learning how to create data visualizations and learning more about sleep deprivation in order to help others have less sleep deprivation. My personal role in the group is the leader.

**Phuong Vu**

My personal goal for this project is to get an insight on how sleep deprivation affects students’ cognitive performance and its potential harm to students’ physical and mental health. From the project, I want to illustrate how harmful is sleep deprivation and encourage other students to manage their time better, so that they can get more sleep. My personal role in the group is coder.

**Yu-Wen Chen**

Learning about sleep deprivation among adults. My personal goal for this project is to have better understanding about the consequences of  lack of sleep and what approach we can take to improve people's sleep. Being an Info 201 student, I hope to be able to apply all the skills I learned in class to contribute to our group project and any future projects. My personal role in the group is researcher..

**Hanzhi Cao**

To find out reasons and solutions behind an obviously phenomenon that cause much negative effect - sleep deprivation. (probably among teenagers who are experiencing a physical and psychological growth at the time period) My personal role in this group is writer.

**A commitment on how you will communicate weekly:**

We use a group text with all of our phone numbers included.

**Commitment on how we will give each other feedback on working together and how you will address communication challenges or work breakdowns:**

We give each other feedback and address communication challenges or work breakdowns in the group text and also one on one text messaging.
