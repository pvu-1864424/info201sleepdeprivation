## 1.0 Introduction
### 1.1 Problem situation

The sleeping trend in the U.S. in recent years has not demonstrated positive changes, especially for adults and some teenagers. They have less sleeping time and poor sleeping quality. According to Envisioning Cards, direct stakeholders are students, workers, and sleep Apps designers. On the other hand, Indirect stakeholders covers a wide range of people in the society, from ear-plug and bedding manufacturers to pedestrians passing the crossroads. Currently, there is no policy designed to protect and solve the problem for people who suffer from sleep deprivation. Some possible causes for sleep deprivation include: (1) schoolwork overload and  (2) meaningless overtime work, which has no policy to protect human rights and only count towards ethnic questions of not squeezing people’s productive values. Our team cares about this situation so much because people tend to take not enough sleep for granted without realizing the potential damage it does to our body. Some people may find it harmless for now because they still have a strong and healthy body, but eventually, it will be too late if bad things happen. The purpose of the project is simply to bring people’s attention and call on them to make changes.

### 1.2 What is the problem?

The sleeping trend in the U.S. in recent years is not going well, especially for adults and some teenagers. They have lesser sleeping time and lower sleeping quality. According to the Envisioning Cards, direct stakeholders can be students, workers, and sleep Apps, designers. Indirect stakeholders can be almost every person in many malicious influences that are generated by sleep deprivation. People's productivity levels will decline and, more severely, they will face the stagnation of social development. It is also possible to increase the risk of illness and cause negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. Right now, the general issue is “if people do not have enough sleep and are suffering from it, what are the causes and how can we get better for it?” The National Alliance on Mental Illness states that up to 44 percent of college students have reported themselves experiencing symptoms of depression, and 50 percent have suffered from anxiety, due to sleep deprivation caused by the overwhelming workload at college (“Mental Health Guide,” 2019).

### 1.3 What does it matter?

The problem of sleep deprivation matters because it influences physical and mental health, as well as their work and their relationships with others. Studies show that sleep deprivation in the long run impacts necessary skills that an adult needs to perform well such as memory recall or concentration, resulting in poor performance when working or doing assignments for school . Moreover, because of sleep deprivation impacts on their cognition, these students’ GPA do not correctly illustrate their understanding of the classes, making grading system less reliable to assess students’ understanding and knowledge-applying of the class. In addition, sleep deprivation can also contribute to mental disorders, such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety (Cunningham, 2019).

### 1.4 How it will be addressed?

Four aspects are being addressed to display this issue. The current trend will be shown in a line graph. And facts will be collected and shown to people, saying that bad things that cause physical and mental harm to people is happening just because of the lack of sleep, such as the number of cases of fatigue driving, anxiety, and prolonged reaction time. A bar graph will simply show the number of cases. Then it’s time to discuss the cause that is leading to this trend. By following a dataset in a life tracking app, a pie chart will display what are people doing for 24 hours a day. Finally, the users’ attention needs to be drawn by listing possible diseases that people might have due to sleep deprivation. A grouped bar graph is the best way to show contrast and changes with and without enough sleep.

The audience of our project would mostly be college students and people who just started to work. Potentially, everyone who is lack of sleep should be drawn to this topic and, ideally, impressed by it.

## 2.0 Research Questions
* What is the current trend of sleep deprivation among adults?
* What are the major causes leading to this trend in U.S.?
* How does sleep deprivation in the U.S affect people’s daily performances?
* What are some potential health risks of not getting enough sleep?

## 3.0 The data set(s)

### Name: Life tracking project dataset

The dataset was created by Maxim Schmidt due to unknown reasons. We retrieved the dataset from Kaggle.com. In this dataset, the observation are 30 days in a month, and the variables are time for different activities, such as sleep, meditation, math, music, work, cook. The size of the dataset was pretty small, only including one person’s data for one month. The data was gathered by a life tracking app. There are both pros and cons for this dataset. The strength is that numbers of activities was listed for variables that cover what normal people would do in life. But the other thing is that this only belongs to one person, which did not cover enough population.

### Name: People’s sleep trend over the last 50 years

The dataset was created by Youngstedt, Shawn D et al to assess whether there has been a reduction in people’s sleep trends over the last decade. We got and reorganized the data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The observations of this data are people’s average sleep time in specific year over the last decade. The variables are sleep time recorded in minutes and studied in two different studies method: polysomnography and actigraphic studies. The size of the data set is relatively small because the data is presented by years. The subject of this project is people’s sleep time over the last decade. The strength of this data is it can illustrate the overall trend of sleep’s time over a long period of time. However, the weakness of this data set is the difference between the results of the two studies’ methods, as well as the year is not quite organized.

### Name: 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health

The creators were Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health. This dataset was designed to see what unhealthy behaviors are affecting and leading to chronic disease among U.S. population within 3 years. We retrieved it from CDC website. The dataset that we used was a small subset after data wrangling. We only filtered rows and columns that we need. The observations are different states. The variables are year, data value of people who sleeps less than 7 hours, and geological location. Subjects are people who took their surveys. The strength of the dataset is that it’s so huge that contains a large population for 3 years. The weakness for our use of the dataset is that we only use states’s data, ignoring details for city and census tracts.

### Name: The role of social determinants of sleep health among college students

The data of this article was collected by Monideepa B. Becerra, Brittny S. Bol, Rochelle Grandos, and Christina Hassija. The article and the dataset were created to benefit people who want to have a closer look at how sleep deprivation affects college students’ lives. Our team accessed the dataset on Taylor & Francis Group. Each observation consists of students' condition, Daytime_Sleepiness that represents whether or not students agree that the condition occurs in their lives, and GPA. This sub-dataset was only made up of three rows and two columns since our team decided to remove irrelevant information and unreadable letters from the original dataset. This dataset specifically focuses on college students in the U.S, so all the people group other than U.S college students are excluded.

## 4.0 Information Visualizations

For showing trend, we did two plot: a plot+fit line plot and a U.S map to visualize the current trend in the U.S. that people are getting less sleep in terms of time and region. The dataset for the map was from 500 cities project by CDC. Different colors were assigned to different state, representing the percentage of people getting less than 7 hours of sleep. Years can also be changed to see the geographical changes. The timeline plot is generated from another research by Shawn D. Youngstedt et al, with an interaction of different study method: one using brain activities dataset, and the other using physical reaction data. With points and best-fit lines, it can show the trend for recent decades.

Moreover, demonstrating the relationship between the lack of sleep and college students’ academic performance, our team decided to visualize the data using a bar chart that shows users students’ average GPA if they feel or do not feel sleepy during the daytime, respectively.

For the life tracking dataset, we changed the raw dataset values into time duration, and calculated the average time for each activity. A bar graph is shown to visualize the contrast between sleep time and other activities’ time.


## 5.0 Technical description of Shiny application

For our project, our team loaded our data through CSV file by using the "read.csv" function in R. However, If the data was not originally a CSV file, we transfer the information to an excel file, then export it as a CSV file. The two major libraries our team implements are Kaggle and visual.ly. Moreover, we also access to data from different research, as well as other websites or articles that provide relevant information. Furthermore, we put our code for data wrangling and visualization into an R file named "analysis.R", and all the datasets are put together in the data folder. Besides, all the markdown files are located in the docs folder. For the Shiny application, we created “app_ui.R" and “app_server.R” to perform the tasks for UI and server, and later source them to “app.R.” Finally, the dataset we found and the calculation we did could answer the question: “What is the trend of people’s sleep since the last decade?”

## 6.0 Conclusion

The strength of our project is that our resources for datasets are from authentic organizations, including American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By using these credible sources, our group ensures that the information presented in our project is reliable. On the other hand, one of the weaknesses of our project is the narrow age range we covered. We only targeted people aged from 18 to 39, which makes up about 26.3 percent of the U.S population. he project could be more applicable to more users. The main lesson our team learned from this project is, the sleeping trend in the U.S in recent years is getting worse. We found out that the lack of sleep could affect not only students' academic performance but also human health. In the future, people could improve the project by extending the age group and provide suggestions to improve people’s sleeping time and sleeping quality. Our team would also like to look deeper into the sleeping trend in different countries other than the U.S to make a comparison, as well as how foreign governments approach sleeping issues.

## Appendix 2: Reflections

### Yu-Wen Chen:

Working on this project, I now have a better understanding on how shiny, ggplot2, and dplyr function in R. At first, just by looking at the shiny app website people made from previous quarter, I was a little intimidated by how much work, research, and coding we have to do to create an interactive website with rich information and plots. However, as I worked through all the process with my team, I realized that building a website is pretty much like building a house. It seems hard and impossible, but if we just be patient and enjoy the process of “building”(which includes researching, coding, communicating with team members, overcoming difficulties) little by little, we will be surprised by how much we have done and how much we can do. However, although working with my team and building the project are interesting, it could be frustrating sometimes. I have struggled with finding relevant dataset and doing data wrangling, but the moment I got it right was so satisfying and I felt a sense of accomplishment. This project is challenging but interesting. I enjoy working on it.

### Hanzhi Cao:

It’s really exciting to work with shiny and see what it can do. Learning new tools can always fascinate me, but on the other hand, it took a long time for me to get familiar with the syntax. As for finding real-life dataset, I found it really hard to find a usable dataset that fits our expectations. Even if we find a dataset, how to reformat the dataset into a way that is clear to see and to plot is extremely hard. Because it’s real-life data, it’s like finding valuable piece from a big file of old newspapers, both time consuming and technically challenging. In the future, I’ll definitely give myself more time to do the project, because this time we started kind of late. My coding skills definitely improved. Logical thinking is also needed for this project to generate new research questions and be critical for the dataset that we are using. As for the identity for innovator, I tried to find an interesting way to build the shiny app and make it more interactive. In general, it’s been a good learning experience.

### Phuong Vu:

From this project, I learned a lot of new interesting applications and syntaxes in R, including data wrangling , the Shiny app, ggplot2, plot_ly and interaction on Github’s repository. Other than the technical knowledge, I also learned to collect data, turn it into a visualization and analyze it to support my point. The most satisfying thing about this project is able to execute your code right away and see what does it look like on real website thanks to the Shiny app. The frustration of working on this project is finding the datasets. It is hard to find suitable datasets for our specific project topic, even when we found one, it requires multiple data wrangling steps to create another data frame that can serve for our visualization. In the future, I would try to look for more styling syntax to make our website look cooler, as well as contacting with my partners sooner and more regularly to ensure equal contribution to the project. This project definitely help me improve my coding skills in R and give me experience creating interactive web for my other projects in the future. As a thinker, this project helps me think critically about a topic through its data and visualization. As an 2innovator, this project keeps me finding better and more creative ways to improve my code and performances . In general, working on this project is a pleasant experience.

## Appendix 3: Use of Envisioning Cards

For this project, our team uses envisioning cards to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of our work. Each envisioning card helps us to think from a different perspective and allows us to create an educational project that benefits not only college students but also the general public. Furthermore, envisioning cards is useful while structuring our project. For example, Direct Stakeholders and Indirect Stakeholder cards were used to generate the problem situation. Long-Term Health and Well-Being card guides us to think about how our project can encourage and raise people’s awareness of the issue of sleep deprivation, and it also highlights the importance of getting enough sleep. These all contribute to our goal to create a healthier society.
